There are some known bugs in the original game:

## Engine

* Right clicking a main menu item will leave that menu, when re-entering the menu, the menus hover effect is missing until it's clicked again
* Hitting enter on selected menu item always goes forward, even if "Cancel" is selected
* When one engine exploded, the other one is shown inside out (bad culling)
* Sometimes re-spawns you directly infront of an obstacle you can't pass because you can't even accelerate enough

## Courses

### Abyss

* Lap-Skip

### Inferno

* Wallrides through ceiling

### Oovo IV

* Wine: loss of control in ovoo tubes and sometimes respawn in rocks, getting the player stuck
* Executioner tubes can be entered backwards without flying

### Tatooine

* Boonta Training Course does not load track part when turning around at a certain point

### Aquilaris

* Sunken City can drive up ramps at start
