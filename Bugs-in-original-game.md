There are some known bugs in the original game:

## Engine

* Right clicking a main menu item will leave that menu, when re-entering the menu, the menus hover effect is missing until it's clicked again
* Hitting enter on selected menu item always goes forward, even if "Cancel" is selected
* When one engine exploded, the other one is shown inside out (bad culling)
* Sometimes re-spawns you directly infront of an obstacle you can't pass because you can't even accelerate enough
* "Lens flares" and "Smoke and dust" will silently be disabled if they are not supported on the system, no warning/error is emitted
* [Best times are not saved on fast PCs](https://www.speedrun.com/swe1r/thread/fsvab)
* [Various issues at high framerates](https://www.speedrun.com/swe1r/thread/kel5z)
* Texture filter which (probably) should only invert color (and preserve alpha) always sets alpha to 0xF (100%)
